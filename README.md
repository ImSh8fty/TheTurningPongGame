*Turning Pong!*

This is a simple game of pong... but with a little "twist". This is also my first ever Unity Project!

In this project, my main goal was to learn the basic function of Unity, which includes:

- Inserting Sprites/Sprite Manipulation
- Creating/Editing Scenes
- UI
- C# Programming with Unity's libraries
