*Turning Pong!*

This is a simple game of pong... but with a little "twist". This is also my first ever Unity Project!

For my iteration of Pong, I took the word "twist" in the most literal sense possible and made the game spin while you play, and the rotation increasingly gets faster as you play. The game will continue spinning until the game is over. 

The reason for this concept was to see how disorientating it would feel while playing pong in a constant moving scene. 
Even though there are only two buttons to play Pong (W/S or Up/Down), I felt the spinning made it more difficult to figure out how to move your paddle the correct way.
